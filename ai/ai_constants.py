# Slack Message Formatting Guide

## Basic Text Formatting

- **Bold**: Use *text* for bold text
- *Italic*: Use _text_ for italic text
- ~~Strikethrough~~: Use ~text~ for strikethrough
- `Code`: Use backticks (`) for inline code
- ```Code blocks```: Use triple backticks for multi-line code blocks
- Line breaks: Use \n for a new line

## Links and Mentions

- URLs: Will automatically be converted to links
- Custom links: <http://example.com|Link text>
- Channel mentions: <#CHANNEL_ID>
- User mentions: <@USER_ID>
- Group mentions: <!subteam^GROUP_ID>
- Special mentions: <!here>, <!channel>, <!everyone>

## Lists and Quotes

- Block quotes: Start line with >
- Lists: Can be created using manual formatting with \n
  Example:
  - Item 1\n
  - Item 2\n
  - Item 3

## Emoji and Special Characters

- Emoji: Can be included directly ðŸ˜„ or as :emoji_name:
- Special characters that need escaping:
  - & becomes &amp;
  - < becomes &lt;
  - > becomes &gt;

## Message Structure

- Primary content should use Block Kit for modern, rich layouts
- Messages can contain:
  - Blocks (primary content)
  - Text (fallback for notifications)
  - Attachments (secondary content - legacy feature)

## Best Practices

1. Use Block Kit for primary content whenever possible
2. Use IDs rather than names for mentions (channels, users, groups)
3. Keep important content in main blocks, not attachments
4. Include fallback text for notifications
5. Format dates using the built-in date formatter for timezone support
